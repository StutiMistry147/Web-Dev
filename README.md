# Web-Dev
## Overview 
Welcome to my repository for web-based applications and interface experiments. This collection focuses on building interactive, user-centric tools using modern web technologies, ranging from productivity utilities to data-driven generators.

## Multi-Language Stack
This repository showcases a full-stack approach to web development:
- <ins>Frontend</ins>: JavaScript for interactivity, HTML for structure, and CSS for responsive design.
- <ins>Backend/Scripting</ins>: Python for data processing and logic automation.
- <ins>Data</ins>: Integration with lightweight data formats like CSV for easy content updates.

## Future Goals
This repository is a live portfolio. I plan to expand into the following areas:
- <ins>React/Vue Integration</ins>: Moving toward component-based frontend frameworks.
- <ins>API Integration</ins>: Connecting applications to live external data sources.
- <ins>Database Management</ins>: Transitioning from static files (like CSV) to dynamic SQL/NoSQL databases.
